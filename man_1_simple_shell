NAME
       simple_shell - a simple UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       ./hsh

DESCRIPTION
       simple_shell is a basic UNIX command line interpreter that
       executes commands read from standard input.

       It works in both interactive and non-interactive modes and
       supports execution of programs found in the PATH environment
       variable, as well as built-in commands.

       The shell displays a prompt when running interactively and
       waits for the user to enter a command followed by a new line.

FEATURES
       - Executes commands with arguments
       - Supports absolute and relative paths
       - Searches executables using the PATH variable
       - Built-in commands:
           * exit : exits the shell
           * env  : prints the current environment
       - Proper error handling
